## Problem statement
Your goal is to predict how likely individuals are to receive their xyz and seasonal flu
vaccines. Specifically, you'll be predicting two probabilities: one for xyz_vaccine and
one for seasonal_vaccine.

## Implemtation
-Handled missing value from the dataset
-Defined models:
   -Logistic Regression: for predicting probabilities in binary classification tasks.
   -MultiOutputClassifier:the problem involves predicting probabilities for multiple labels 
- Performed Cross-Validation
- Calculated the Mean Cross-Validation Score
